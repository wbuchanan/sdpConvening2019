# Fighting the Good Fight: Organizing Market Forces for Data Interoperability, Integration, & Privacy
We've created a repository that we can use to take questions stemming from our session at the [10th Annual Strategic Data Project Convening](https://sched.co/OEGC).  If you do have a question, please feel free to submit a new issue and we will try to address your questions as time permits.  We also hope that this can be a space where multiple organizations can share practices they have found effective to improve the data interoperability and integration landscape in the education sector.

## Overview
What do you do when your organization’s data is sequestered in a third-party vendor’s system? This question is the heart of our panel of the nation’s leading organizations that are working to improve data interoperability, integration, and privacy from the organizations that are leading the way in this space. From developing data interoperability standards to grassroots organizing of LEAs and SEAs, you’ll learn how Project Unicorn, the Ed-Fi Alliance, and IMS Global Learning Consortium leverage their strength in numbers to move the market to an ecosystem of interoperability. You’ll also get to hear what the world’s largest cloud computing provider (Amazon Web Services) is doing to address interoperability and integration issues and can learn about the implications of FERPA and COPPA on data interoperability, integration, and privacy analysis from the Future of Privacy Forum. Our panel illustrates the existing strength in numbers that these organization’s wield and provides you with an opportunity to learn new strategies for managing vendors, gaining access to your data, and helping your vendors move out of the age of carrier pigeons and papyrus and into a world where data flows effortlessly through APIs. Most importantly, we want you to leave our session equipped with new strategies that you can use to get data flowing back into your organization from the third party tools you use.
