# Your Question
Your submission should take the form of a question.  The question could either be directly related to data interoperability/integration in the education sector or to ask for an improvement/update to something in the repository.

# If I had the answer to this question I could...
This is a way of creating a value proposition and business case for your question all in one shot.  If you are just curious about something that is completely legitimate and fine too.  

# Important information
Please, do not use the names of any vendor(s) and/or product(s) in a way that they might perceive as directly hostile and/or harmful to their brand.  Core contributors to this repository can and will delete issues they believe to be counter productive to advancing data interoperability/integration efforts in the education sector at their sole discretion.
